\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access Token} is a credential used to access protected resources.
    An access token is an opaque string representing an authorization issued to the client.
    The string is usually opaque to the client.
    Tokens represent specific scopes and
    durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.
    \item \textbf{Refresh Token} is a credential used to obtain a new pair of access and refresh tokens when they become
    invalid or expired, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope.
    Access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner.
    Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server.
    \item \textbf{Resource Owner} is an entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
    When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.
    \item \textbf{Resource Server} is the server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected
    resource requests using access tokens.
    \item \textbf{Client} is an application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.
    This term does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server,
    a desktop, or other devices).
    \item \textbf{Authorization Server} is the server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner
    and obtaining authorization.
