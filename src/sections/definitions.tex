\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access Token} -- is data used to authenticate to a protected resource.
    Mostly often the access token is in JWT-format constructed of several
    consecutive parts separated by dots.
    Each part is Base64-encoded.
    \item \textbf{Refresh Token} -- is data used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires.
    Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server.
    \item \textbf{Resource Owner} -- is the entity capable to provide authorization to a protected resource.
    When the resource owner is a person, this person is called an end user.
    \item \textbf{Resource Server} -- is a server that stores protected resources and can only be accessed after validation of access token.
    \item \textbf{Client} -- is an application that accesses protected resources.
    \item \textbf{Authorization Server} -- is the server that issues access tokens to the client after successful authentication.
