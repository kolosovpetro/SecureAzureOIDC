In this manuscript, we discuss the problem of secure storage and transfer of access tokens between microservices.
Web browsers may store access tokens both in local storage and in cookie files.
We propose a secure implementation
to store and transfer authentication cookies between microservices using Azure Active Directory,
OpenID Connect, and ASP .NET Core.
