Access Token is data used to authenticate to a protected resource. Most often the access token is in JWT-format, that is, in the form of several 
consecutive parts, separated by dots. Each part contains a base64url-encoded value.

Refresh Token is data used to get new access tokens when the current access token becomes invalid or expires. Refresh tokens are issued to the client by 
the authorization server.

Resource Owner is the entity capable of presenting authorization to access a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is called an end user.

A Resource Server is a server that stores protected resources and can only process requests to those resources after checking for the appropriate access token.

Client is an application that makes requests to protected resources.

Authorization Server is the server that issues access tokens to the client after successful authentication.
