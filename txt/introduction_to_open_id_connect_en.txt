====Definition of OpenId Connect====

OpenId Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on 
the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner. 

====How OIDC related to OAuth 2.0====

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner 
by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own 
behalf.

OAuth 2.0 provides various standardized message flows based on JSON and HTTP; OpenID Connect uses them to provide identity services.

====What problems solve OAuth 2.0 and what are benefits of OAuth in compare of Basic authorization====

In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client requests an access-restricted resource (protected resource) on the
server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's credentials. In order to provide third-party applications access to
restricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with the third party. This creates several problems and limitations:

1. Third-party applications are required to store the resource owner's credentials for future use, typically a password in clear-text.

2. Servers are required to support password authentication, despite the security weaknesses inherent in passwords.

3. Third-party applications gain overly broad access to the resource owner's protected resources, leaving resource owners without any ability to 
restrict duration or access to a limited subset of resources.

4. Resource owners cannot revoke access to an individual third party without revoking access to all third parties, and must do so by changing 
the third party's password.

5. Compromise of any third-party application results in compromise of the end-user's password and all the data protected by that password.

OAuth addresses these issues by introducing an authorization layer and separating the role of the client from that of the resource owner. 
In OAuth, the client requests access to resources controlled by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server.
Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources, the client obtains an access token

====Explain the diagram OAuthPkceScheme_1570_1055====

1. After clicking on the "Sign in with Google" button, you are redirected to the authorization endpoint, where the resource owner must enter his 
credentials, as well as agree to some conditions. Particular attention should be paid to code_challenge and code_challenge_method, the first is some string
that will be encoded using the encoding method specified in the code_challenge_method request parameter. In the future, when exchanging the received code 
for an access and refresh token, we will have to present the code_verifier value, which is equal to the previously coded code_challenge.

2. After successful authentication, it will redirect to redirect_uri.
As for the request parameters code and state:

Code is an authorization code that is obtained through an authorization server and mediates between clients and resource owners.
Before the authorization server redirects the resource owner back to the client, the authorization server verifies the authenticity of the resource owner.
So because the resource owner only authenticates with the authorization server, their credentials are never sent to the client.

State is the value used by the client to store the state between the authorization request and the callback. 
The authorization server enables this value when redirecting the user agent back to the client.
This parameter is used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

3. After receiving the authorization code, this code is exchanged for access and update tokens. If earlier, when redirecting the resource owner to 
the authorization endpoint, we specified code_challenge and code_challenge_method, now, when exchanging code for tokens, we must pass the value of code_verifier
in the request.

====What is Proof of Key Code Exchange (PKCE) and what vulnerability it solves?====

Authorization code flow with PKCE is a protocol that represents a client generated secret that can be verified by an authorization server.
This secret is called code_verifier. The client hashes the code_verifier value and writes it to the code_challenge parameter.
PKCE solves the problem of secure code exchange. If an attacker manages to get an authorization code, then he will not be able to exchange it for 
access and refresh tokens. In this way, we ensure that the exchange of code for tokens produces the same application that performed the authentication.
In a way, PKCE can be compared to the digital signature of an authentication process. When exchanging an authorization code for tokens, you must specify the code_verifier.
